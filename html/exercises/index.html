      My goals for creating a website are multifaceted. <br>
      Firstly, I aim to showcase the skills that I have acquired through my journey in coding. This platform will serve as a testament to my growth and proficiency in various programming languages and technologies.<br> 
      Secondly, it provides me with an opportunity to be creative, allowing me to experiment with different design elements and functionalities. <br>
      Lastly, I seek to gain valuable experience in this area, which will not only enhance my technical expertise but also prepare me for future professional endeavors in web development.<br>
