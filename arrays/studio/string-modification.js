//1) Use string methods to remove the first three characters from the string and add them to the end.
//Hint - define another variable to hold the new string or reassign the new string to str.
let newStr = str.slice(0,3);

//Use a template literal to print the original and modified string in a descriptive phrase.

let phrase = "JavaScript rocks!";
console.log(phrase[phrase.length - 8]);

//2) Modify your code to accept user input. Query the user to enter the number of letters that will be relocated.

//3) Add validation to your code to deal with user inputs that are longer than the word. In such cases, default to moving 3 characters. Also, the template literal should note the error.
